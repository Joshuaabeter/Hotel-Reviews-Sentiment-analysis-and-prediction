Hotel Review Sentiment Analysis and Prediction

Overview

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis and prediction on hotel reviews. The goal is to analyze customer sentiments expressed (positive, negative, or neutral) in hotel reviews and develop a predictive model to determine the sentiment of future reviews. The sentiment analysis can provide valuable insights for hotel management to improve customer satisfaction and enhance their services.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and consists of hotel reviews and corresponding ratings. The dataset contains the following information:
Review: The text of the hotel review.
Rating: The rating given by the customer (ranging from 1 to 5 stars).
The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, remove irrelevant information, and perform text normalization techniques such as lowercasing, punctuation removal, and stopwords removal.

Project Structure

The project follows the following steps:
Data exploration: Understand the structure and characteristics of the hotel review dataset.
Data preprocessing: The raw dataset is cleaned and transformed to prepare it for analysis. The cleaning involved removing stopwords, punctuation, and performing tokenization, stemming, or lemmatization.  It also includes handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns, and performing text preprocessing techniques.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The preprocessed dataset is analyzed to gain insights into the distribution of ratings, review lengths, and other relevant patterns. Visualizations and statistical summaries are used to explore the data.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the text data, such as word frequencies, n-grams, or TF-IDF vectors. Additional features are derived from the text data to capture more information for sentiment analysis. This may include word counts, sentiment scores, or other relevant linguistic features.
Model Development: Machine learning models, such as Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, or Random Forest Classifier , are trained on the labeled dataset to classify reviews into positive or negative sentiments. Various models and algorithms are explored and evaluated for their performance.
Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Cross-validation techniques are applied to assess the models' generalization performance.
